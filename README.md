# Leaflet Mapquest Routing

Internet of Things Homework Two. Objectives are
1. Get the current position of the user and mark it on the map. Use the leaflet.js plugins to do that. 
2. The  user inputs the destination by clicking on the map. Add a marker to show it.
3. Use the routing plugin to calculate the route and show it on the map.
4. The  map sends a  POST  of the  current and destination positionsto the server.
5. The device then does a GET to grab the positions and  updates the arrowâ€™s direction according to the angle between the from and to positions.
6. When the position changes on the map, the map application sends a GET to the socket server which saves it. The device then uses a GET to retrieve the new position.
